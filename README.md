Create instances of classes i.e.:

neural = NeuralNetwork()
regression = Regression()

Default data set = "train.csv" but u can send ur own data inputs in constructor - data format must be same as in train.csv.
Target - you specify which column in data file will be our target (our "y").
Checkpoint - how much of given data will be train - rest will be test.

Constructor train neural network or calculate regression (depending on used class).
Later on we can use method predictate(data) to predict Y based on input data.

Most of things described also in code as comments.
